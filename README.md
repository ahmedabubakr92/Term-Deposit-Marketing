# Term Deposit Marketing

We are a small startup focusing mainly on providing machine learning solutions in the European banking market. We work on a variety of problems including fraud detection, sentiment classification and customer intention prediction and classification.

We are interested in developing a robust machine learning system that leverages information coming from call center data.

Ultimately, we are looking for ways to improve the success rate for calls made to customers for any product that our clients offer. Towards this goal we are working on designing an ever evolving machine learning product that offers high success outcomes while offering interpretability for our clients to make informed decisions.

The goal is to Predict if the customer will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit (variable y)

In Conclusion
After perfroming exploratory data analysis on the dataset. I've came to notice some few useful insights in targeting clients:

Targeting clients with an age ranging between 31-46 is more likely to lead for a subscription.
Most of the targeted clients are of the blue-collar and management even though they are more likely to decline. Instead, i'd recommend going after people in admin, services, retired, self-employed and entrepreneurs.
People who are married are more likely to say no. So, single and divorced people are more likely to say yes.
Also, people with no default credit are more likely to decline.
Looking at balance, people with balance exceeding 50,000 are going to decline.
People with housing loans are likely to decline.
Instead of focusing on contacting clients mostly on May, months like Apr, Jun, Jul and Feb seems more promising.
Regarding the model, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier model produced the best results with an average score of 0.86.
